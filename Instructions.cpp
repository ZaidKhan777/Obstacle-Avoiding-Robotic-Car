This GitHub repository hosts the code for an Arduino-based obstacle avoiding car. The car is designed to autonomously navigate its environment while avoiding obstacles using an ultrasonic sensor. The code controls the movement of the car's wheels and the rotation of the ultrasonic sensor to detect obstacles and maneuver accordingly.

Key Features:

Obstacle Detection: The car is equipped with an ultrasonic sensor that measures distances to objects in its path.
Autonomous Navigation: Using the distance measurements from the ultrasonic sensor, the car determines whether there are obstacles within a certain range and navigates to avoid collisions.
Motor Control: The code includes functions to control the direction and speed of the car's wheels for forward, backward, left, and right movements.
Servo Motor Control: A servo motor is used to rotate the ultrasonic sensor, allowing the car to scan its surroundings and detect obstacles from different angles.
Modular Code: The code is structured into functions for easy understanding and modification, facilitating adjustments to the car's behavior and control.
How to Use:

Hardware Setup: Connect the Arduino board to the car's motor drivers, ultrasonic sensor, and servo motor following the provided schematic or wiring diagram.
Upload Code: Upload the provided Arduino sketch to the Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.
Run the Car: Power on the car and observe its behavior as it autonomously navigates its environment, avoiding obstacles detected by the ultrasonic sensor.
